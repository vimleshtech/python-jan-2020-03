DataScience: is very vast concept which focus to datastructure, data model, data clean and variable different cocept 
	- data science is init step to understand the ml,ai and other advance topics

There are following inbuilt modules in python which commonaly used in datascience:

- numpy		: is known as numerical python to manage ndimenssion data 
- pandas 	: is module to mange dataframe
